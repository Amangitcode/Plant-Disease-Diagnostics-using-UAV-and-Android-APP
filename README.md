Plant diseases causes many significant damages and losses in crops around the world. Some suitable measures on disease identification should be introduced to prevent damages and minimize losses. Early Detection of Disease helps in increasing the crop productivity as well as in minimizing expense. Technical approaches using machine learning and computer vision are actively researched to achieve intelligence farming by early detection on plant disease. The accuracy of object detection and recognition systems has been drastically improved by the recent development in Deep Neural Networks. By using these systems and implementation of computer vision and machine learning techniques, plant diseases can be detected. Here we have used transfer learning based approach to diagnose diseases of different plants using its images captured by camera devices either drone or smartphone. Our goal is to build a market oriented product for Plant Disease Detection, a smartphone app compatible with both smartphone camera and drone camera. The target group of the user is those who request a quick diagnosis on common leaf disease at any time of the day i.e. Farmers, agricultural industries, agricultural consultants and Government Agencies &amp; Departments.
